          My name is Jacob Arguijo, and I am attending the University of California Riverside full-time to study business. I was born on July 28, 2004, in Lakewood, California. My origins are from Mexico and El Salvadore. Growing up, I met many people since Iâ€™ve been to several different schools throughout my adolescence. These schools ranged from other cities, public and private. So Iâ€™ve had plenty of experience familiarizing myself with new environments. I am a social person who loves to communicate and work in teams. On the contrary, I donâ€™t mind working by myself to get the job done. Some personal hobbies of mine include going to car meets, going out with friends, as well as working out. These hobbies had changed drastically compared to a few years ago when my hobbies at the time were watching TV and playing video games. I am grateful for this personal change of hobbies because I feel like It steers me into the lifestyle I would rather live than what it would have been. If I didnâ€™t make this change now, I feel like my life in the business industry would be nonexistent, and I wouldnâ€™t be interested in collaborating with others working towards an end goal. I also would be much less confident since I was continuing to be and was, at the time, very out of shape. Now I have improved my lifestyle and eating habits to ensure that wonâ€™t happen again. While I am not currently employed. I have worked for companies such as Stater Bros and UPS, raising a little over $10,000 from both careers. Some goals I have in the future are to eventually get a new car and start working again, whether that be a regular job or an internship. To get there, I am reminding myself every day of these goals and the steps I have to take in order to achieve them. When I was applying to the UC schools, I selected my major in engineering so that's why, originally went to UCR with a Mechanical Engineering degree, but now I am currently in business. While my current major is business, I plan to specialize in finance and possibly double major in sales to complete my portfolio. At the end of the day, I wish to be able to take care of the ones I love in my life. To achieve such an aspiration, I champion the idea of maximizing my opportunities and always focusing on learning something new to prepare me for any obstacles that happen to be in my way throughout my career. On top of that, I pray to God daily to remind myself of grateful my life is. I am a humble, multi-talented, hard-working individual who has won the employee of the month on four occasions throughout my career at Stater Bros. I plan to specialize in the finance field to become a financial advisor. Mid-career, I plan to have an MBA and achieve a greater position at whichever company I work for.
